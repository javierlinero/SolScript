Upon analyzing the contract, one major vulnerability is identified, which relates to the DASP category:\n\n1. **Unrestricted Gas Consumption**:\n   - Lines where `_setTokenURI(tokenId, tokenURI)` is called in the `mintNFT` and `updateTokenURI` functions are potential vulnerabilities. `_setTokenURI` is not a standard function in OpenZeppelin's ERC721 implementation because ERC721 standard doesn't mandate storing token URI on-chain. Depending on how `_setTokenURI` is implemented, if it stores data on-chain, this operation could lead to high gas consumption and could be expensive or even hit block gas limits if the `tokenURI` provided is large. This unexpected high gas consumption can be problematic in terms of efficiency and cost. Note that this assumption is based on typical patterns in extending ERC721 functionality; the actual implementation details of `_setTokenURI` would be needed to confirm the vulnerability.\n\n   - Vulnerability occurs at:\n     - `mintNFT`: Line 15\n     - `updateTokenURI`: Line 26\n\nSummary of vulnerabilities according to DASP standards: <1>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the below smart contract, diagnose any vulnerabilities it has according to the DASP (https://dasp.co/) standard \n                        and point out the specific lines at which the vulnerabilities occur.

Although the function is restricted to the contract owner with `onlyOwner`, this does not consider actual token ownership, which is central to ERC-721 functionality.\n\n2. **Unknown Function or Method (`_setTokenURI`)**:\n   - The function `_setTokenURI` used in `updateTokenURI` at line 22 is not a part of the OpenZeppelin ERC721 contract and is assumed to be a custom method or inherited from another extension.
