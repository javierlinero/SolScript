This centralization can lead to a single point of failure and vulnerability if these roles' security is compromised (DASP - Dangerous Delegate).\n\n2. **Unsafe Ownership Transfer**: The two-step ownership transfer mechanism (setting a `pendingOwner` and having them claim ownership) divides control but can introduce potential risks if `pendingOwner` is not appropriately validated during assignment in `transferOwnership` or if this role is left unclaimed or incorrectly assigned (Lines 18 and 23). An attacker could potentially call `transferOwnership` and later claim ownership if they gain access to the `pendingOwner` account.\n\n3. **Authorization Flaws with Two Modifiers**: By having separate modifiers (`onlyOwner` and `onlyPendingOwner`), actions by different parties are controlled, but relying without other checks can be risky if internal logic fails. If an adversary manipulates the `owner` or `pendingOwner` improperly via external interactions or buggy code, they can gain unauthorized control over contract functions.\n\n<3>"}]
